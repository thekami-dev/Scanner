## About

Most scanner apps are slow to open, full of permissions you never asked for, or both. Scann does one job: point the camera at a code, see what is inside, and act on it.

You can also create your own QR codes, scan from a gallery image, and start scanning straight from a Quick Settings tile without opening the app first.

## App info

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Android 7.0+ (API 24) |
| Price | Free |
| License | GPL-3.0, open source |
| Package | `com.scann.thekami` |
| Account | Not needed |

| Your scans | Processed on your device |

## How it works

1. Open the app and point the camera at a QR code or barcode.
2. Scann reads it on-device and detects the content type: link, text, Wi-Fi, contact and so on.
3. Pick an action from the result screen, such as open, copy or share.
4. Need a code of your own? Use the Generator tab to create one and share it.

| Min / target SDK | 24 / 36 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: signed APK builds, GitHub Releases, Play Store publishing |

### Branches

| Branch | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `test` | Lint, unit tests and a debug APK, available from the Actions run. No release. |
| `main` | Builds a signed release APK and publishes it as a GitHub Release (`v1.0.<n>`). |
| `store` | Publishes a GitHub Release (`store-v1.0.<n>`) and sends the build to Google Play Production. |

The version code is the git commit count, so history is never rewritten on release branches.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekami-dev/Scanner.git
cd Scanner
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is created in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Release builds need a signing setup (`key.properties` and a keystore), which is not included in the repository.

## Privacy

Scanning and generating happen on your device, and scanned content is not uploaded by the app. The app shows banner ads through Google AdMob, which may collect device and advertising data under Google's own policies.
